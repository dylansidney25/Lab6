this lab uses he raspberry pi camera to take a picture when the button is
pushed. the hardware in ths lab that i will be using in my 
project is the raspberry pi camera. the project will take images and analyse
them to determine car position. lab 6 v2 works on a timer that takes a picture 
then deletes it after a few seconds. this is groundwork to take many pictures
to be analised but nt fill up memory.
